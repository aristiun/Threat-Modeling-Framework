# Threat Modeling Framework

This repository contains the Aristiun Threat Modeling Framework, a comprehensive and structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats to your systems and applications.


**Key Features:**

* **Structured Step-by-Step Approach:** Guides users through the process of threat modeling, making it accessible to those with varying levels of expertise.
* **Modular Design:** The framework is divided into five distinct components:
    * **Input to the Framework:** This module gathers necessary information for effective threat modeling, including regulatory requirements, security policies, threat intelligence, and potential threat actors.
    * **Exposure:** This module focuses on identifying the potential attack surface of the application by defining its external and internal exposure.
    * **Environments (Platforms, AI, SaaS, etc.):**  This module provides a detailed overview of the technological environment in which the application operates, including the following:
        * **Traditional On-Premise:** Systems and applications hosted within an organization's physical data center (e.g., physical servers, network devices, operating systems, databases, on-premise applications).
        * **Cloud Environments:**
            * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**  Provides access to virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine).
            * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a platform for developing and deploying applications (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google App Engine, Heroku).
            * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Provides access to cloud-based applications over the internet (e.g., Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Dropbox).
        * **Hybrid Cloud:** A mix of on-premise and cloud environments.
        * **Edge Computing:**  Extends computing and data processing to the edge of the network (e.g., IoT devices, edge gateways, fog computing).
        * **AI-Specific Environments:** 
            * **AI Training Data:** Large datasets used to train AI models.
            * **AI Model Deployment:** Environments where trained AI models are deployed and run.
              
    * **Core High-Level Threats & Security Requirements:**  This module outlines common security threats and their corresponding security requirements, organized by these core areas:
        * **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
        * **Data Security & Privacy**
        * **Infrastructure Security** 
        * **Security Logging, Monitoring & Response** 
        * **IT Resilience** 
        * **Secure Development**
        * **Cloud Security**
        * **Attack Surface Management**
        * **AI Security**
     
  
    * **Threats and Security Requirements (Application-Specific):** This module integrates findings from previous modules to identify potential threats specific to the application and define necessary security controls and mitigations.
* **Ease of Use Within an Enterprise Environment:**  The framework is designed to be easy to use and integrates seamlessly with existing enterprise tools and systems. 
* **Alignment & Integration:** Aligns and integrates with existing architecture, development, and security processes within an enterprise environment.
* **Flexibility:**  Can be used at any stage of the development lifecycle, allowing for both proactive threat modeling and retrospective assessments. 

**Using the Threat Modeling Framework:**

1. **Input to the Framework:**  Start by gathering relevant information about the application, including its purpose, target users, regulatory requirements, applicable security policies, relevant threat intelligence, and potential threat actors.
2. **Exposure:**  Identify the application's external and internal exposure to determine potential attack vectors.
3. **Environments:**  Analyze the specific technological environments where the application operates, considering potential security challenges related to each environment.
4. **Core High-Level Threats & Security Requirements:**  Review common security threats and their corresponding security requirements in the core areas listed above.
5. **Threats and Security Requirements (Application-Specific):** Combine the insights from previous modules to identify specific threats to the application and define the necessary security controls and mitigations. 

**Benefits:**

* **Proactive Security:** Identify and address potential threats before they can be exploited.
* **Enhanced Security Posture:** Improve the overall security posture of your systems and applications.
* **Reduced Risk:** Mitigate security risks and minimize the impact of successful attacks.
* **Improved Compliance:**  Align with regulatory requirements and security best practices.
